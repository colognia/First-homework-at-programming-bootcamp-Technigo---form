## My process
- making a sketch with figma 
- build html
- create css
- write a little javascript
- check and verify frequently with firefox and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools, checking stackoverflow



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- vanilla JS
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned

First I was looking for nice examples to get ideas, I wanted to to sth with a transparent background.
Then I made a feature plan, what my form should do how both views should look like. I sketched the basic structure of my nested containers.  Then I found an appropriate background image. 
First I spend 4 hours on figma to create 2 layouts and figma is new to me. 
Finally started coding html first and then styling from top to bottom, mobile view first.
Used a little bit of JS first time and had problems with it, but finally got a hin from a classmate.

### Continued development

Want to use more JS slowly but surely. Want to get faster.

### Useful resources

w3schools, dev.mozilla.org, stackoverflow, my bootcamp Technigo, Videos of Kevin Powell (css god)
