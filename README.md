## My process
- check out examples for forms, collecting screenshots, going for transparent form
- making a feature plan: what form should do and how both views should look like. I sketched the basic structure of my nested containers. Working with li items like suggested made no sense for me, so used divs.
- finding appropriate background image 
- making a sketch with figma (4 hours)
- build html top to bottom, mobile first
- create css
- write a little javascript for first time
- check and verify frequently with firefox and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools, checking stackoverflow

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- vanilla JS
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned

Had to deal with figma which is new to me, took me a lot time to get kind of used to it.
Used a little bit of JS first time and had problems with it, but finally got a hint from a classmate and later as well from freecodecamp forum to explain why it was not working.

### Continued development

Want to use more JS slowly but surely. Want to get faster.

### Useful resources

w3schools, dev.mozilla.org, stackoverflow, my bootcamp Technigo, Videos of Kevin Powell (css god)
